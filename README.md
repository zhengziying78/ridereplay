# RideReplay

`RideReplay` is an iOS app that generates 2D and 3D flyover videos of bike rides, ski days, and other outdoor activities.

### Why Iâ€™m Building This

Thereâ€™s currently no great, mobile-first way to create flyover videos *after the fact*. Existing tools all have trade-offs:

1. **Strava** offers flyovers, but requires a paid subscription ($79.99/year).
2. **Relive** creates flyovers, but only if you record your ride with their app â€” no support for importing from RideWithGPS, Garmin Connect, etc.
3. **[MapDirector](https://mapdirector.com/)** is free and works great, but it's not mobile-first and lacks direct RideWithGPS integration.
4. Other solutions exist, but none offer a streamlined, mobile-friendly workflow for generating ride replays from existing data.

`RideReplay` aims to fill that gap.
